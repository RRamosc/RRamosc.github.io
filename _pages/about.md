Hi, I currently work as an Economic Research and Data Science Consultant in the Office of Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness (SPD) at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/). I have over 2 years of experience doing qualitative and quantitative research, as well as participating in the design and implementation of survey experiments and RCTs.

I have a B.A degree in Political Science from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). I am highly motivated in using data insights for better policy design, implementation and evaluation, along with improving the process of decision making.
