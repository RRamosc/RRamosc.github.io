In historically patriarchal societies such as Peru, the topic of sexuality revolves in a context of myths,
taboos, and lack of information. Within this, sexual dysfunctions are conceived as disorders or
pathologies that require the closest solution. Thus, this research aims to explain the ways in which
sexual dysfunctions, female and male, are approached from the medical discourse. Through an
eminently qualitative methodology that has professionals in the health field as a sample, the main
findings refer to the causes of sexual dysfunctions and the gender approach present in the entire
process of diagnosis, treatment, and perception. As a cause, the social factor plays an important but
always delimited in what is considered psychological or psychosomatic. Likewise, the generational and
gender aspect of the interviewees was fundamental to explain differences regarding their medical
perspectives and heteronormative perspectives. Finally, it is concluded that, the perception of sexual
dysfunction is affected by constructions of femininity and masculinity typical of hetero-cis-patriarchal
systems.
